\usage{
optimize_template_detector(
  template.correlations,
  reference,
  threshold,
  cores = 1,
  pb = TRUE,
  by.sound.file = FALSE,
  previous.output = NULL,
  macro.average = FALSE,
  min.overlap = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{template.correlations}{An object of class 'template_correlations' (generated by \code{\link{template_correlator}}) in which to optimize detections. Must contain data for all sound files as in 'reference'. It can also contain data for additional sound files. In this case the routine assumes that no sound events are found in those files, so detection from those files are all false positives.}

\item{reference}{Data frame or 'selection.table' (following the warbleR package format) with the reference selections (start and end of the sound events) that will be used to evaluate the performance of the detection, represented by those selections in 'detection'. Must contained at least the following columns: "sound.files", "selec", "start" and "end". \strong{It must contain the reference selections that will be used for detection optimization}.}

\item{threshold}{Numeric vector of length > 1 with values between 0 and 1 specifying the correlation threshold for detecting sound event occurrences (i.e. correlation peaks). Must be supplied. \strong{Several values should be supplied for optimization}.}

\item{cores}{Numeric. Controls whether parallel computing is applied.
It specifies the number of cores to be used. Default is 1 (i.e. no parallel computing).}

\item{pb}{Logical argument to control progress bar and messages. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{by.sound.file}{Logical to control if diagnostics are calculated for each sound file independently (\code{TRUE}) or for all sound files combined (\code{FALSE}, default).}

\item{previous.output}{Data frame with the output of a previous run of this function. This will be used to include previous results in the new output and avoid recalculating detection performance for parameter combinations previously evaluated.}

\item{macro.average}{Logical argument to control if diagnostics are first calculated for each sound file and then averaged across sound files, which can minimize the effect of unbalanced sample sizes between sound files. If \code{FALSE} (default) diagnostics are based on aggregated statistics irrespective of sound files. The following indices can be estimated by macro-averaging: overlap, mean.duration.true.positives, mean.duration.false.positives, mean.duration.false.positives, mean.duration.false.negatives, proportional.duration.true.positives, recall and precision (f.score is always derived from recall and precision). Note that when applying macro-averaging, recall and precision are not derived from the true positive, false positive and false negative values returned by the function.}

\item{min.overlap}{Numeric. Controls the minimum amount of overlap required for a detection and a reference sound for it to be counted as true positive. Default is 0.5. Overlap is measured as intersection over union.}
}
\value{
A data frame in which each row shows the result of a detection job for each cutoff value, including the following diagnostic metrics:
\itemize{
 \item \code{true.positives}: number of sound events in 'reference' that correspond to any detection. Matching is defined as some degree of overlap in time. In a perfect detection routine it should be equal to the number of rows in 'reference'.
 \item \code{false.positives}: number of detections that don't match any of the sound events in 'reference'. In a perfect detection routine it should be 0.
 \item \code{false.negatives}: number of sound events in 'reference' that were not detected (not found in 'detection'. In a perfect detection routine it should be 0.
 \item \code{splits}: number of detections overlapping reference sounds that also overlap with other detections. In a perfect detection routine it should be 0.
 \item \code{merges}: number of sound events in 'detection' that overlap with more than one sound event in 'reference'. In a perfect detection routine it should be 0.
 \item \code{recall}: Proportion of sound events in 'reference' that were detected. In a perfect detection routine it should be 1.
 \item \code{precision}: Proportion of detections that correspond to sound events in 'reference' that were detected. In a perfect detection routine it should be 1.

\description{
\code{\link{optimize_template_detector}} optimizes acoustic template detection
}
\details{
This function takes a a reference data frame or 'selection_table' ('X') and the output of \code{\link{template_correlator}} and estimates the detection performance for different detection parameter combinations. This is done by comparing the position in time of the detection to those of the reference selections. The function returns several diagnostic metrics to allow user to determine which parameter values provide a detection that more closely matches the selections in 'reference'. Those parameters can be later used for performing a more efficient detection using \code{\link{template_detector}}. Supported file formats:'.wav', '.mp3', '.flac' and '.wac'.
