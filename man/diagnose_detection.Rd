\title{Evaluate the performance of a sound event detection procedure}
\usage{
diagnose_detection(reference, detection, by.sound.file = FALSE,
time.diagnostics = FALSE, cores = 1, pb = TRUE, path = NULL, by = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{reference}{Data frame or 'selection.table' (following the warbleR package format) with the reference selections (start and end of the sound events) that will be used to evaluate the performance of the detection, represented by those selections in 'detection'. Must contained at least the following columns: "sound.files", "selec", "start" and "end". \strong{It must contain the reference selections that will be used for detection optimization}.}

\item{detection}{Data frame or 'selection.table' with the detections (start and end of the sound events) that will be compared against the 'reference' selections. Must contained at least the following columns: "sound.files", "selec", "start" and "end". It can contain data for additional sound files not found in 'references'. In this case the routine assumes that no sound events are found in those files, so detection from those files are all false positives.}

\item{by.sound.file}{Logical argument to control whether performance diagnostics are summarized across sound files (when \code{by.sound.file = FALSE}, when more than 1 sound file is included in 'reference') or shown separated by sound file. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{time.diagnostics}{Logical argument to control if diagnostics related to the duration of the sound events ("mean.duration.true.positives", "mean.duration.false.positives", "mean.duration.false.negatives" and "proportional.duration.true.positives") are returned (if \code{TRUE}). Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{cores}{Numeric. Controls whether parallel computing is applied.
It specifies the number of cores to be used. Default is 1 (i.e. no parallel computing).}

\item{pb}{Logical argument to control progress bar. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{path}{Character string containing the directory path where the sound files are located. If supplied then duty cycle (fraction of a sound file in which sounds were detected)is also returned. This feature is more helpful for tuning an energy-based detection. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{by}{Character vector with the name of a column in 'reference' for splitting diagnostics. Diagnostics will be returned separated for each level in 'by'. Default is \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
A data frame including the following detection performance diagnostics:
\itemize{
 \item \code{total.detections}: total number of detections
 \item \code{true.positives}: number of sound events in 'reference' that correspond to any detection. Matching is defined as some degree of overlap in time. In a perfect detection routine it should be equal to the number of rows in 'reference'.
 \item \code{false.positives}: number of detections that don't match (i.e. don't overlap with) any of the sound events in 'reference'. In a perfect detection routine it should be 0.
 \item \code{false.negatives}: number of sound events in 'reference' that were not detected (not found in 'detection'. In a perfect detection routine it should be 0.
 \item \code{split.positives}: number of sound events in 'reference' that were overlapped by more than 1 detection (i.e. detections that were split). In a perfect detection routine it should be 0.
 \item \code{merged.positives}: number of sound events in 'reference' that were overlapped by a detection that also overlaps with other sound events in 'reference' (i.e. sound events that were merged into a single detection). In a perfect detection routine it should be 0.
 \item \code{mean.duration.true.positives}: mean duration of true positives (in ms). Only included when \code{time.diagnostics = TRUE}.
 \item \code{mean.duration.false.positives}: mean duration of false positives (in ms). Only included when \code{time.diagnostics = TRUE}.
 \item \code{mean.duration.false.negatives}: mean duration of false negatives (in ms). Only included when \code{time.diagnostics = TRUE}.
 \item \code{overlap.to.true.positives}: ratio of the time overlap of true positives in 'detection' with its corresponding reference sound event to the duration of the reference sound event.
 \item \code{proportional.duration.true.positives}: ratio of duration of true positives to the duration of sound events in 'reference'. In a perfect detection routine it should be 1. Based only on true positives that were not split or merged.
 \item \code{duty.cycle}: proportion of a sound file in which sounds were detected. Only included when \code{time.diagnostics = TRUE} and \code{path} is supplied. Useful when conducting energy-based detection as a perfect detection can be obtained with a very low amplitude threshold, which will detect everything, but will produce a duty cycle close to 1.
 \item \code{recall}: Proportion of sound events in 'reference' that were detected. In a perfect detection routine it should be 1.
 \item \code{precision}: Proportion of detections that correspond to sound events in 'reference'. In a perfect detection routine it should be 1.
 \item \code{f1.score}: Combines recall and precision as the harmonic mean of these two. Provides a single value for evaluating performance. In a perfect detection routine it should be 1.

\description{
\code{diagnose_detection} evaluates the performance of a sound event detection procedure comparing the output selection table to a reference selection table
}
\details{
The function evaluates the performance of a sound event detection procedure by comparing its output selection table to a reference selection table in which all sound events of interest have been selected. The function takes any overlap between detected sound events and target sound events as true positives. Note that all sound files located in the supplied 'path' will be analyzed even if not all of them are listed in 'reference'. When several possible matching pairs of sound event and detections are found, the optimal set of matching pairs is found through bipartite graph matching (using the R package igraph). Priority for assigning a detection to a reference is given by the amount of time overlap.
